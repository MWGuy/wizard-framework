# Wizard Framework

Wizard Framework is a jphp framework for the web/mobile/desktop.

# How to taste?

If you want to see our framework in action, you can use the `sandbox` project in the `sandbox/` directory.
Run in your console:

```
cd <path_to_wizard_dir>

./gradlew sandbox
```

Then, open `http://localhost:5000/app` in your browser (opera, chrome or firefox). Your browser
must support the WebSocket feature.
